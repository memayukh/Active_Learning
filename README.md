This repository is organized as follows:

# Code:
This folder contains a single ipynb notebook containing the code that was used to carry out the experiments for the four different datasets. 

# Datasets:
This folder contains the datasets used for the experiments. All the datasets have been fetched from the KEEL data repository.

# Figures:
This folder contains 2 figures that describes the AL-OD and ALOD-RE algorithms proposed in our paper.

# Results:
This folder contains the results that we have achieved after simulating the experiment. The results have been stored in individual folders for the respective datasets. Each folder contains two .xlsx files for each Query by Committee (QBC) active learning method and Uncertainty Sampling (US) active learning method.
